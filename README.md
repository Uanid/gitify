#Gittify

Customized bash environment, making git folders more friendly.

This project provides bash/git customization files. Running the
**gittify** command, starts a new **bash** shell and overrides
its console PS1.
New console line informs about the state of current git
working copy (e.g. name of the current branch) in a colorful manner.

Also some aliases are defined in **.gitconfig** file. **Appending** them
to your own .gitconfig file provides more functionality (listed below).
**DO NOT OVERWRITE your .gitconfig containing your username, email, etc.**

##Most useful aliases
For all aliases, look in the homefolder/.gitconfig file :) But most useful
ones are as follows:

 * git lg

   Prints a colorful one-line-per-commit log.

 * git st

   Prints the status.

 * git unstage _somefile_

   Unstages the _somefile_.

##Installation

1. Copy _bin/gittify_ file into _~/bin/_ folder (or add it to the $PATH),
2. Copy _homefolder/git.bashrc_ file to your _home folder_ (gittify script uses it),
3. **Append** contents of _homefolder/.gitconfig_ to your _.gitconfig_ file.
